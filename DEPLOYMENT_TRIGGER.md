# Deployment Trigger

This file was created to force Vercel to detect new commits and trigger a fresh deployment.

## Issue
Vercel is building from old commit 6751a67 instead of latest commits with fixes.

## Solution
- Deleted problematic script files causing TypeScript errors
- Updated tsconfig.json to exclude scripts directory
- Multiple version bumps to force deployment

## Latest Commits
- f3cf5971: Force deployment with version bump to 0.1.2
- d567688e: Update README and force new deployment  
- e406d441: Remove problematic script files causing build failures
- d681e76b: Trigger new deployment - version bump to 0.1.1
- 014fdbd7: Exclude scripts directory from TypeScript compilation

## Expected Result
Build should now succeed without TypeScript errors and deploy performance optimizations.

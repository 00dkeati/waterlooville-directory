We are not renting out our house - they came here, entered our property without permission, and put it up without making sure it was the right address. An absolute disgrace, they will be reported to the police/council. They must have stepped on our lily, which has sentimental value - it is now almost sideways. 😡 No respect to our property whatsoever.",

With an approximate population of 27,500 residents, it forms a significant part of the local landscape, encompassing electoral wards such as Battins, Bondfields, Barncroft, and Warren Park. This area, once a collection of farms and estates, has evolved into a bustling residential hub with a unique story.</p><h2>A Glimpse into Leigh Park's Past</h2></p><p>The history of Leigh Park stretches back centuries, with mentions of a farm on the site as early as 1750. The Leigh Park Estate, a notable feature in its early days, was celebrated for its beauty, described in 1826 as "one of the most beautiful spots in the county" [3]. This estate boasted decorative planting, serene lakes, and intriguing follies, remnants of which can still be found within Staunton Country Park today [2].</p><p>The most transformative period for Leigh Park occurred in the aftermath of the Second World War. The area was re-developed to provide housing for those displaced and left homeless by the extensive bomb damage in nearby Portsmouth. In 1944, Portsmouth City Council acquired the land from the Fitzwygram family, initiating construction in 1947, with the first residents moving into their new homes by 1949. The rapid development continued, and by the early 1970s, the estate was largely complete [1]. Initially conceived as a wholly council estate, the landscape of Leigh Park has shifted over time, with many properties now privately owned due to the 'right to buy' scheme.</p><h2>Geography and Natural Surroundings</h2></p><p>Geographically, Leigh Park is bordered to the east by the Havant to Petersfield railway line and its northern extent is broadly defined by the A3M and B2150 junction. The area is largely flat, with gentle rises towards the north. Two notable streams, the Hermitage Stream and the Lavant Stream, meander through parts of Leigh Park, eventually flowing into Langstone Harbour, which lies approximately a mile to the south [8, 9]. Staunton Country Park, with its historical significance and natural beauty, lies on the northern edge of Leigh Park, offering residents and visitors alike a tranquil escape.</p><h2>Community Life and Facilities</h2></p><p>Leigh Park is a self-sufficient community with a range of facilities. The main shopping precinct, featuring Park Parade and Greywell Shopping, has been serving residents since 1955 [1]. For education, the area is home to several primary schools, including Front Lawn, Trosnant, and Warren Park, as well as secondary schools like Havant Academy and Park Community School [11, 12].</p><p>Sports play a significant role in the community, with Havant & Waterlooville Football Club, a non-league side, being a local point of pride. The area also hosts Havant Hockey Club and the Leigh Park Bowls Club. The Front Lawn Community Hub, following a £1.5 million upgrade, offers state-of-the-art facilities including a 3G artificial football pitch, multisport courts for tennis, basketball, and netball, and community spaces [13]. Leigh Park Boxing Club is also based at the local community centre.</p><p>Leigh Park's transport links are robust, with Stagecoach South bus routes connecting the suburb to central Havant, Portsmouth, and other surrounding areas. Havant railway station serves as the nearest major train station, with smaller stations at Bedhampton and Rowlands Castle also accessible [1]. The A3(M) motorway and A27 Havant bypass provide crucial road connections to the wider region.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>From its origins as a rural estate to its development as a significant post-war housing project, Leigh Park has grown into a vibrant and well-equipped community. Its blend of historical roots, natural surroundings, comprehensive facilities, and strong community spirit makes it a distinctive and important part of Hampshire.</p><h2>References</h2></p><p>[1] "Leigh Park." <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Park.
